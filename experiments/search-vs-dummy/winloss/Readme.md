Search vs dummy, winloss reward
-------------------------------

These configurations were created due to the difference in performance obtained in 
Light vs AHTN, PuppetAB and PuppetMCTS: directly in microRTS in a laptop, LightRush
wins almost every match. But on the university servers, running through our engine,
LightRush loses almost every match to AHTN.
